## Why build on Bhindi though?

    - **Ease of Access** – 15+ OAuth apps ready to connect out of the box
    - **Rapid Development** – Focus on your idea, not on setup or boilerplate
    - **LLM Tooling Familiarity** – If you've built tools for LLMs before like MCP's, you'll feel right at home
    - **Bhindi Context Protocol (BCP)** – Enhanced context management for richer agent capabilities. You can say a better version of "MCP's".
    - **Open Source Starter Kit** – TypeScript-based template to jumpstart your agent
    - **Public & Private Tools** – You can create public tools like calculator, status checkers, character counters, etc. and private tools like GitHub, Notion, Google Workspace, Slack, and more.
    - **Comprehensive API & Docs** – Standardized endpoints, Swagger UI, and Postman collection for easy testing
    - **Advanced Features** – Parameter validation, error handling, and confirmation flows built-in
    - **Production-Ready Patterns** – Strict typing, JSON Schema validation, and robust error handling
    - **Active Support & Community** – Help available via Discord, X/Twitter, and email
