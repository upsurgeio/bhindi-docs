## Step-by-Step Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build & Deploy Your Agent" icon="hammer">
    **Prepare your agent for production**
    
    - Build your agent following our [development guide](/custom-agent/development-process)
    - Deploy it to a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint
    - Verify both `/tools` and `/tools/:toolName` endpoints are responding correctly
    - Test your agent locally before deployment
    
    <Tip>
      Use services like Railway, Vercel, or Heroku for easy deployment. Make sure your endpoint supports HTTPS.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Register with Bhindi" icon="plus">
    **Add your agent to the Bhindi ecosystem**
    
    1. Start a new chat on [Bhindi.io](https://bhindi.io)
    2. Use the **Bhindi Agent Manager** with this format:

    <Card title="Basic Agent Registration" icon="code">
      ```
      Add my agent using Bhindi Agent Manager. The details are as follows:

      id: your-agent-id
      name: Your Agent Name
      description: Your Agent Description
      endpoint: https://your-agent-endpoint.com
      ```
    </Card>

    <Card title="Agent with OAuth Services" icon="link">
      ```
      Add my agent using Bhindi Agent Manager. The details are as follows:

      id: my-github-analyzer
      name: GitHub Repository Analyzer
      description: Analyzes GitHub repositories and provides insights
      endpoint: https://my-github-analyzer.com
      oauth: github, discord
      ```
    </Card>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Advanced Settings" icon="gear">
    **Set up OAuth and custom headers (if needed)**
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="OAuth Configuration">
        <Card title="Connect Required Services" icon="key">
          For agents needing access to external services like GitHub, Google, Discord, etc.
        </Card>

        **Before registering your agent:**
        1. Visit [bhindi.io/apps](https://bhindi.io/apps)
        2. Connect all required services your agent needs
        3. Include the OAuth services in your registration message

        <Warning>
          OAuth agents only get access to predefined scopes configured in Bhindi, ensuring secure and limited access to connected accounts.
        </Warning>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Custom Headers">
        <Card title="Configure Agent Headers" icon="list">
          Set up custom headers for API keys, endpoints, and other configuration.
        </Card>

        **After your agent is registered:**
        1. Go to [Apps](https://bhindi.io/apps)
        2. Find your agent in the list
        3. Click the `Configure` button
        4. Add necessary headers and save configuration

        <Info>
          Custom headers are perfect for API keys, project IDs, or service-specific configurations your agent needs.

  <Card title="Description Tips" icon="pen">
    **Writing effective descriptions**
    
    - Be specific about what your agent does
    - Mention key features and use cases
    - Keep it under 200 characters
    - Use action-oriented language
    
    *Example: "Analyzes GitHub repositories, tracks issues, and provides development insights with automated reporting"*
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## OAuth Integration

<Card title="Supported OAuth Services" icon="shield">
  Your agent can request access to any of the 15+ integrations available in the
  Bhindi ecosystem, including GitHub, Google Workspace, Discord, Slack, and
  more.
</Card>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="How OAuth Works">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="User Connects Apps" icon="link">
        Users connect their accounts at [bhindi.io/apps](https://bhindi.io/apps) before using OAuth agents.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Agent Requests Access" icon="key">
        Your agent specifies which OAuth services it needs during registration.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Secure Access Granted" icon="shield">
        Bhindi provides limited access tokens with predefined scopes only.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Security Model">
    <Card title="Limited Scope Access" icon="lock">
      Your custom agent will only get access to specific, predefined scopes - not full authentication access to user accounts.
    </Card>

    **Security Benefits:**
    - No direct access to user credentials
    - Limited to necessary permissions only
    - Tokens are managed by Bhindi
    - Regular security audits and monitoring

    <Info>
      This security model protects both users and agent developers by limiting access to only what's needed.

  <Tab title="Available Services">
    <Card title="Popular OAuth Integrations" icon="plug">
      Connect your agent to popular services that users already love.
