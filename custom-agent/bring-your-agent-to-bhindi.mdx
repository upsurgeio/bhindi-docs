### Integration Process

1. **Create & Deploy Your Agent**
   - Build your agent using this development guide
   - Deploy it to a publicly accessible endpoint
   - Ensure both `/tools` and `/tools/:toolName` endpoints are working
2. **Add Agent to Your Bhindi Account**
   - Start a new chat on [Bhindi.io](https://bhindi.io)
   - Use the following message format:

```
Add my agent using Bhindi Agent Manager. The details are as follows:

id: your-agent-id
name: Your Agent Name
description: Your Agent Description
endpoint: https://your-agent-endpoint.com
```

3. **With OAuth Integration (Optional)**
   - For agents that need access to services like GitHub, Google, Discord, etc.
   - First connect the required apps at [bhindi.io/apps](https://bhindi.io/apps)
   - Include OAuth services in your agent registration:

```
Add my agent using Bhindi Agent Manager. The details are as follows:

id: my-github-analyzer
name: GitHub Repository Analyzer
description: Analyzes GitHub repositories and provides insights
endpoint: https://my-github-analyzer.com
oauth: github, discord
```


Add my agent using Bhindi Agent Manager. The details are as follows:

```
id: my-github-analyzer
name: GitHub Repository Analyzer
description: Analyzes GitHub repositories and provides insights
```
### Required Information

- **id**: Unique identifier for your agent (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
- **name**: Display name for your agent
- **description**: What your agent does and its capabilities
- **endpoint**: Public HTTPS URL where your agent is deployed
- **oauth** (optional): Comma-separated list of services your agent needs access to

### OAuth Access

For agents requiring OAuth access:

1. **Connect Apps First**: Visit [bhindi.io/apps](https://bhindi.io/apps) and connect the required services (GitHub, Google, Discord, etc.)
2. **Account Access**: Your custom agent will get access to predefined scopes only, not full authentication access to connected accounts
3. **Supported Services**: Include any of the 15+ integrations available in the Bhindi ecosystem

**Note**: OAuth agents can only access the specific scopes that are currently configured in Bhindi, ensuring secure and limited access to your connected accounts.

### Integration Support

The **Bhindi Agent Manager** will guide you through the integration process and help resolve any issues during setup.

1. Go to [Apps](https://bhindi.io/apps)
2. Find your agent in the list.
3. Click on `configure` button.
4. Add the headers and save configuration.
