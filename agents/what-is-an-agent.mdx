An agent is a specialized software program that can perform specific tasks autonomously. Think of it as your digital assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant that can interact with various applications, APIs, and services to get things done on your behalf.

- **Connect to specific services** (like Gmail, Slack, Notion, GitHub, etc.)
