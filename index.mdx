## üöÄ Quick Start

### 5-Minute Setup

Clone the agent-starter-kit repository and get your agent up and running in minutes:
https://github.com/upsurgeio/bhindi-agent-starter

```bash
# 1. Clone the starter template
git clone https://github.com/upsurgeio/bhindi-agent-starter.git starter-kit
cd starter-kit

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev

# 4. Test your agent
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/tools/countCharacter' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "character": "s",
  "text": "strawberrry"
}'
```

### Minimal Working Example

Here's a complete, runnable agent:

```typescript
import { Router } from 'express';

const router = Router();

// GET /tools - Return available tools
router.get('/tools', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    tools: [
      {
        name: 'greet',
        description: 'Send a friendly greeting',
        parameters: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            name: {
              type: 'string',
              description: 'Name of the person to greet'
            }
          },
          required: ['name']
        }
      }
    ]
  });
});

// POST /tools/:toolName - Execute a tool
router.post('/tools/:toolName', (req, res) => {
  const { toolName } = req.params;
  const { name } = req.body;
  
  if (toolName === 'greet') {
    res.json({
      success: true,
      data: {
        text: `Hello ${name}! Welcome to Bhindi agents!`
      }
    });
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({ 
      success: false,
      error: { message: 'Tool not found', code: 404 }
    });
  }
});

export default router;
```

## üèóÔ∏è Agent Architecture

### How Agents Work

### Authentication & Endpoint Overview

---

## üìã Core Requirements

Every agent must implement **2 required endpoints** and **1 optional endpoint**:

### Required Endpoints

1. **`GET /tools`** - Returns available tools and their parameters
2. **`POST /tools/:toolName`** - Executes a specific tool

### Tool Structure

Each tool follows this format:

```typescript
{
  name: string;                    // Tool identifier
  description: string;             // What the tool does
  parameters: {                    // JSON Schema for parameters
    type: 'object';
    properties: Record<string, any>;
    required?: string[];
  };
  confirmationRequired?: boolean;  // Requires user confirmation
  credits?: number;               // Cost in credits
}
```

### Response Format

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "text": "Your response content" }
}
```

**Error Response:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Error description",
    "code": 400,
    "details": "Additional details"
  }
}
```

## üîê Authentication

To let agents use integrations like GitHub, Gmail, Discord etc from the [Bhindi Agents Directory](https://directory.bhindi.io/), requests to the agent endpoint include the below headers.

Read [Connecting your agent to Bhindi](#-bringing-your-custom-agent-to-bhindi) for more details.

### Basic Authentication

```bash
x-api-key: your-secret-key
```

### OAuth Authentication (Optional)

```bash
x-api-key: your-secret-key
Authorization: Bearer oauth-token
```

### Variable Headers (Optional)

```bash
x-api-key: your-secret-key
x-dburi: mongodb://connection-string
x-custom-var: custom-value
```

---

## üß™ Testing Your Agent

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test tools endpoint
curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" http://localhost:3000/tools

# Test tool execution
curl -X POST \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "World"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/tools/greet
```

For comprehensive testing examples including OAuth and variable headers, see the [development guide](./development-guide.md#testing-your-agent).

## üöÄ Bringing Your Custom Agent to Bhindi

Once you've built and deployed your agent, you can easily integrate it with [Bhindi.io](https://bhindi.io) to make it accessible through the platform.

### Integration Process

1. **Create & Deploy Your Agent**
   - Build your agent using this development guide
   - Deploy it to a publicly accessible endpoint
   - Ensure both `/tools` and `/tools/:toolName` endpoints are working
2. **Add Agent to Your Bhindi Account**
   - Start a new chat on [Bhindi.io](https://bhindi.io)
   - Use the following message format:

```
Add my agent using Bhindi Agent Manager. The details are as follows:

id: my-special-calculator
name: Special Calculator
description: A powerful calculator that can perform complex mathematical operations and generate visualizations
endpoint: https://my-calculator-app-here.com
```

3. **With OAuth Integration (Optional)**
   - For agents that need access to services like GitHub, Google, Discord, etc.
   - First connect the required apps at [bhindi.io/apps](https://bhindi.io/apps)
   - Include OAuth services in your agent registration:

```
Add my agent using Bhindi Agent Manager. The details are as follows:

id: my-github-analyzer
name: GitHub Repository Analyzer
description: Analyzes GitHub repositories and provides insights
endpoint: https://my-github-analyzer.com
oauth: github, discord
```

### Required Information

- **id**: Unique identifier for your agent (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
- **name**: Display name for your agent
- **description**: What your agent does and its capabilities
- **endpoint**: Public HTTPS URL where your agent is deployed
- **oauth** (optional): Comma-separated list of services your agent needs access to

### OAuth Access

For agents requiring OAuth access:

1. **Connect Apps First**: Visit [bhindi.io/apps](https://bhindi.io/apps) and connect the required services (GitHub, Google, Discord, etc.)
2. **Account Access**: Your custom agent will automatically get authentication access for the connected accounts
3. **Supported Services**: Include any of the 100\+ integrations available in the Bhindi ecosystem

### Integration Support

The **Bhindi Agent Manager** will guide you through the integration process and help resolve any issues during setup.
